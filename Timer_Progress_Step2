/* 
This program acts as a simple timer that measures how long it takes for the user to press the Enter key. 
It starts timing when the prompt appears and waits for input. 
If the user presses Enter, the timer stops and the elapsed time is calculated and displayed. 
If the user types “q” or “Q”, the program ends and displays a completion message. 
The program uses the C++ <chrono> library for precise time measurement and std::getline for input handling, 
allowing it to detect an empty Enter press correctly.This work represents the second step in my progressive learning process, where each program
builds upon the previous one to improve accuracy, performance, and understanding of real-time
systems in C++.
