This program is a simple metronome .This is my progress step number 3 .
It asks the user for a BPM (beats per minute), calculates the time interval between beats, and prints “Tick” messages at that rate. 
It runs in a loop, using precise time delays to control the rhythm. 
A separate thread waits for the user to press ENTER, and when that happens, it safely stops the metronome.
Finally, the program displays the total time it ran and exits cleanly
