In my link video is a early working version. The core real-time audio engine and note detection were already functional. Since recording i notice
that i have a problem with time signature i pluck my guitar in the correct time signature of metronome but the feedback was too early or too late and sometimes perfect .
I've made significant debugging progress:
1)Refactored from dual callbacks to a single duplex callback to eliminate threading issues ,but i notice the problem was still there.
2) Maybe the problem is the connected cable with my amplifier.
I will keep test the code with my guitar until a new update.
