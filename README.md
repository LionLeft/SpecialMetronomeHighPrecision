I’m 43 years old and a student of Computer Science, as well as a guitar student — I’ve been taking lessons for seven years and still continue to do so.

One day, while struggling with a guitar exercise, I decided to combine my passion for music and programming to solve the problem. That’s when I came up with the idea of creating a metronome that can "hear" the notes you play and give feedback when you make mistakes.

I imagine an application similar to Guitar Pro, but enhanced with an AI-powered exercise helper that analyzes your performance in real time. I’ve been learning everything necessary to make this idea a reality — combining my studies in computer science with my love for music.
