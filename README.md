I’m a 43-year-old Computer Science student at the Hellenic Open University and also a guitar student — I’ve been taking guitar lessons for seven years and continue to do so.

One day, while struggling with a guitar exercise, I decided to combine my passion for music and programming to solve the problem. That’s when I came up with the idea of creating a metronome that can “hear” the notes you play and give feedback when you make mistakes.

I imagine an application similar to Guitar Pro, but enhanced with an AI-powered exercise assistant that analyzes your performance in real time.

Since then, I’ve been learning everything necessary to make this idea a reality — combining my studies in computer science with my love for music.I documented the entire development process by creating small, focused proof-of-concept programs at each stage. This ensures every core function is validated and tested independently.
